# Individual Research

## Agile Values/Prioritisation
### Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
- If the team aren't communicating effectively or capable, it doesn't matter 
how good your tools or processes are 
### Working Software over Comprehensive Document
- You shouldn't let documentation be a bottle neck for creating software
and getting it into the hands of the customer/client
### Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
- Having constant customer feedback is crucial to provide a product that the 
client wants and is happy with
- The earlier in a project that you can identify an issue or misunderstanding 
the better
### Responding to Change over Following a Plan 
- If circumstances significantly change, a plan that was designed without 
these changes in mind will not likely be the best way of moving forward
## Scrum
### The process
- Divides work up into manageable chunks that can be achieved over a short 
period of time, or a 'Sprint'

## Epic and User Stories
### What is a User Story?
- User stories, sometimes just called stories, are a series of low level requirements or requests from a user's perspective.
- A specific task within a wider Epic, that can be completed in a sprint.
- Format is "As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]."
- Should be accompanied by functional acceptance criteria (minimum conditions that must be met).
### What is an Epic Story?
- An Epic story is a large body of work that is much larger in scope, usually large enough to not be completable in a single sprint.
- High level functional and non-functional (technical) requirements from a business user's perspective.
- These are useful to cover the functionality of a product and in estimating the time and budget required for these large scale features.
- Can be used when discussing the project with stakeholders as it is more of an overview which will be easier to understand without a technical background.
- Multiple teams may work on an Epic story at the same team, with each team focusing on a different set of user stories within that Epic.
- Progress in an Epic can be measured in a Burndown Chart to display work done and work remaining.
### How do these fit into an Agile environment using Scrums?
- Organising work into Epics and User stories to be completed over one or many sprints can be a very useful way of creating your sprint backlog during a scrum.
- Epics allow a team to have one large goal to work towards while focusing on the smaller user stories during the sprint.
- User stories and Use Cases can help a client to communicate and design the functional and non-functional (technical) requirements.
- Agile environments are all about rapid iteration, so when using scrums it makes perfect sense to break down a large requirement into smaller sections that can be completed in each sprint. Which is exactly what Epic and User stories facilitate.
### Planning Poker
- Planning poker is a method of gaining an estimate of effort for a story based
on team discussion
- Customer/Client reads a user story
- Team members make individual estimates without discussing it
- The team reveals their estimates at the same time
- The team discuss the estimates, especially outlying values
- Repeat process until consensus is reached
- Helps avoid anchoring bias in scrums
- Uses fibonacci sequence to give time estimations
### INVEST
- Checklist to assess quality of a User story
- Quality stories should be:
- Independant of other stories
- Negotiable, to be able to discuss further
- Valuable to the customer/client
- Estimable, so that they can be allocated to iterations/sprints
- Small enough to fit in an iteration or sprint
- Testable, so that it meets given acceptance criteria for the customer/client
