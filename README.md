# Individual Research

## Agile Values/Prioritisation
### Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
- If the team aren't communicating effectively or capable, it doesn't matter 
how good your tools or processes are 
### Working Software over Comprehensive Document
- You shouldn't let documentation be a bottle neck for creating software
and getting it into the hands of the customer/client
### Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
- Having constant customer feedback is crucial to provide a product that the 
client wants and is happy with
- The earlier in a project that you can identify an issue or misunderstanding 
the better
### Responding to Change over Following a Plan 
- If circumstances significantly change, a plan that was designed without 
these changes in mind will not likely be the best way of moving forward
## Scrum
### The process
- Divides work up into manageable chunks that can be achieved over a short 
period of time, or a 'Sprint'
