# Individual Research

## Agile Values/Prioritisation
### Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
- If the team aren't communicating effectively or capable, it doesn't matter 
how good your tools or processes are 
### Working Software over Comprehensive Document
- You shouldn't let documentation be a bottle neck for creating software
and getting it into the hands of the customer/client
### Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
- Having constant customer feedback is crucial to provide a product that the 
client wants and is happy with
- The earlier in a project that you can identify an issue or misunderstanding 
the better
### Responding to Change over Following a Plan 
- If circumstances significantly change, a plan that was designed without 
these changes in mind will not likely be the best way of moving forward
## Scrum
### The process
- Divides work up into manageable chunks that can be achieved over a short 
period of time, or a 'Sprint'
### How it links to Agile
- Scrums offer a framework to help the team to work together and continuously produce deliverables
- Can use Scrums in a non agile setting or as a step towards agile
- They are both focused on continous improvement so they fit together well
- Framework that allows the team to adapt to new challenges and grow throughout the development process
### Scrum Roles
- Scrum Master: Upholds Agile Values and makes sure that everyone involved can do what they need to do
- Product Owner: Understands customer needs to be able to manage the scrum backlog
- Development Team: The people doing the work to complete the sprint goals
### Scrum Ceremonies
- Sprint Planning: Deciding what to tackle this sprint
- Daily Scrum: Short standup meeting to get everyone on the same page
- Sprint Review: Meeting where the team demo what they've accomplished in the sprint
- Sprint Retrospective: Identifying what went well and what problems arose for that sprint, and how that knowledge can be used going forward
### Scrum Artifacts
- Product backlog: Ever evolving list of features needed for a product
- Sprint backlog: List of objectives to complete during this sprint
- Burndown charts- Graphical representation of remaining work in a given sprint. Updated during daily scrums
### How have we implemented Agile?
- We have had daily scrums where we've talked about the previous days work and consolidated knowledge
- We have used Trello to show our Product and Sprint backlogs, moving tasks into the Done sections once completed
- At the end of the week we've had Sprint reviews about the topics covered that week
- The weekly one to one meetings with the trainers have acted as Sprint Retrospective
- We have broken down large tasks into many smaller ones and interated on many of them to constantly improve
### ¿Cuáles son los 3 amigos?
- The 3 perspectives to consider when  examining an increment of work so that everyone is on the same page regardless of where there expertise lie, and eliminates areas of confusion and misunderstanding early on
- Business: Expectations from user stories
- Development: Understanding of requirements and the length of time required to complete that increment
- Testing: Finding edge cases and thinking about how the test cases match up with the outlined acceptance criteria
## Epic and User Stories
### What is a User Story?
- User stories, sometimes just called stories, are a series of low level requirements or requests from a user's perspective.
- A specific task within a wider Epic, that can be completed in a sprint.
- Format is "As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]."
- Should be accompanied by functional acceptance criteria (minimum conditions that must be met).
### What is an Epic Story?
- An Epic story is a large body of work that is much larger in scope, usually large enough to not be completable in a single sprint.
- High level functional and non-functional (technical) requirements from a business user's perspective.
- These are useful to cover the functionality of a product and in estimating the time and budget required for these large scale features.
- Can be used when discussing the project with stakeholders as it is more of an overview which will be easier to understand without a technical background.
- Multiple teams may work on an Epic story at the same team, with each team focusing on a different set of user stories within that Epic.
- Progress in an Epic can be measured in a Burndown Chart to display work done and work remaining.
### How do these fit into an Agile environment using Scrums?
- Organising work into Epics and User stories to be completed over one or many sprints can be a very useful way of creating your sprint backlog during a scrum.
- Epics allow a team to have one large goal to work towards while focusing on the smaller user stories during the sprint.
- User stories and Use Cases can help a client to communicate and design the functional and non-functional (technical) requirements.
- Agile environments are all about rapid iteration, so when using scrums it makes perfect sense to break down a large requirement into smaller sections that can be completed in each sprint. Which is exactly what Epic and User stories facilitate.
### Planning Poker
- Planning poker is a method of gaining an estimate of effort for a story based
on team discussion
- Customer/Client reads a user story
- Team members make individual estimates without discussing it
- The team reveals their estimates at the same time
- The team discuss the estimates, especially outlying values
- Repeat process until consensus is reached
- Helps avoid anchoring bias in scrums
- Uses fibonacci sequence to give time estimations
### INVEST
- Checklist to assess quality of a User story
- Quality stories should be:
- Independant of other stories
- Negotiable, to be able to discuss further
- Valuable to the customer/client
- Estimable, so that they can be allocated to iterations/sprints
- Small enough to fit in an iteration or sprint
- Testable, so that it meets given acceptance criteria for the customer/client
